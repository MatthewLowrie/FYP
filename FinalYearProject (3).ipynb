Which also correlates to the amount\n","  of goals the older players get due to their greater efficiency with each shot due to the average being in the range of 0.11-0.12, whereas the younger players (<25) have a goal range of 0.08-0.1.\n","\n","  On the other hand, the age range with the most assissts is the 20-24 age range meaning they are more liekly to be a team player and willing to pass the ball to get an assist. This\n","  could be because around this age the player is working to become the best they can, but they are rarely the ebst in the squad at this age meaning their ego cannot be too high\n","  allowing them to be open th play the ball to their team mate more often. We also see that the youngest player (<20) are the lowest on theasissts at a value of 0.047, a reason for \n","  this could be due to them trying to get into the first team resulting in them attempting to score goals rather than create them.\n","\n","  Comparing the tackling stats we see that the younger players (<25) have more tackles per game and a higher tackle win rate. But, the older players have a higher success rate when it comes\n","  to tackling a player who is running directly at them, showing that the younger players are more likely to press a player and win the ball back but the older players are\n","  more likely to successfully defend an attacker when they are dribbling towards the goal.\n","\n","  Building on this point the youngest age bracket has a higher tackles per game stat and a higher yellow cards per game stat which means they are more reckless with their tackles on average compared to\n","  the older players.

ages of 25 and 30 they are the most likely to be played in a game aswell as playing the most minutes.\n","  We can also see that older players are most likely to get the most game time as the players above 25 have the most minutes compared to the players\n","  under 25.\n","\n","  A possible reason for this would be experience, a team is more likely to start more experienced players and only have one or two less experienced players\n","  to ensure the quality of the team does not drop\n","\n","  However the Younger players have more shots on targets per game but the age range of 25-30 have the highest shot on target percentage which shows, the older players\n","  have less shots per game but they are more accurate with their shots which linking back to the previous point shows their experience. Which also correlates to the amount\n","  of goals the older players get due to their greater efficiency with each shot due to the average being in the range of 0.11-0.12, whereas the younger players (<25) have a goal range of 0.08-0.1.\n","\n","  On the other hand, the age range with the most assissts is the 20-24 age range meaning they are more liekly to be a team player and willing to pass the ball to get an assist. This\n","  could be because around this age the player is working to become the best they can, but they are rarely the ebst in the squad at this age meaning their ego cannot be too high\n","  allowing them to be open th play the ball to their team mate more often. We also see that the youngest player (<20) are the lowest on theasissts at a value of 0.047, a reason for \n","  this could be due to them trying to get into the first team resulting in them attempting to score goals rather than create them.\n","\n","  Comparing the tackling stats we see that the younger players (<25) have more tackles per game and a higher tackle win rate. But, the older players have a higher success rate when it comes\n","  to tackling a player who is running directly at them, showing that the younger players are more likely to press a player and win the ball back but the older players are\n","  more likely to successfully defend an attacker when they are dribbling towards the goal.\n","\n","  Building on this point the youngest age bracket has a higher tackles per game stat and a higher yellow cards per game stat which means they are more reckless with their tackles on average compared to\n","  the older players. To support this point further the younger players have a higher red card per game stat which further supports the point of younger players being more reckless\n","  and less efficient with their tackles.\n","  \n","Would you like to go back to the main menu or quit?: (y for main menu, n for quit) n\n","Thank you for using our program!\n"]}],"source":["intro()\n","Ask_Choice()\n","\n","again = True\n","\n","while again == True:\n","  \n","  restart = input(\"Would you like to go back to the main menu or quit?: (y for main menu, n for quit) \")\n","\n","\n","  if restart.lower() == 'y' :\n","    clear_output()\n","    Ask_Choice()\n","  else:\n","    again = False\n","    print(\"Thank you for using our program!\")\n","    quit()\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"mount_file_id":"19Dz3HvL8iK912kKqj5h6H8v-JH-0MnYW","authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMzRBYrkfq7tOWSm1vu8NXw"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
